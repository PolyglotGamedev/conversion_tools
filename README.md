# conversion_tools

polyglotTOOL by Felix Caffier
built for windows, osx, linux using PowerBasic 5.21 LTS

- converts CSV to XML and/or JSON
- outputs separated language definition files
- used to fill the JSON and XML repositories here

Feel free to improve upon the CSV code, there are still several edge cases that have not been properly implemented yet.
